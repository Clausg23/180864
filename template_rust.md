## Python Program to Illustrate Different Set Operations

  <li>1. In this example, we have defined two set variables and we have performed different set operations: union, intersection, difference and symmetric difference.,  </li>
  <li>2. To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Python programming topics:  </li>
  <li>3.Python Sets  </li>
  <li>4. Python Input, Output and Import  </li>
  <li>Python offers a datatype called set whose elements must be unique. It can be used to perform different set operations like union, intersection, difference and symmetric difference. </li>
  <li>Is the Quadratic Allocation Problem NP-complete or is it in P? Either give a reduction to show it is NP-complete or give a polytime algorithm to solve it. </li>

 
</ol>
Aside: This problem arose during some consulting I was doing, where the integers represented the sizes of different software jobs, and the quadratic term is there because the cost of implementing software goes up faster than linearly with the size of the job.

## Source Code example 
https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/hello.html

#### Hello World Program in Rust
Hello World
This is the source code of the traditional Hello World program.

##### Scenario
A simple application written in F# that prints Hello, World! to the console.

Hello World! program in every programming language gives the beginner programmer a leap in proceeding further in the new language. The basic Hello world program just gives the output by printing ” Hello World!” on the screen. In Perl, a basic program consists of the following steps of execution,

##### Step 1: Transfer the file to Rust Compiler:
Create your app
In your command prompt, run the following commands:

```rust
// This is a comment, and is ignored by the compiler
// You can test this code by clicking the "Run" button over there ->
// or if you prefer to use your keyboard, you can use the "Ctrl + Enter" shortcut

// This code is editable, feel free to hack it!
// You can always return to the original code by clicking the "Reset" button ->

// This is the main function
fn main() {
    // Statements here are executed when the compiled binary is called

    // Print text to the console
    println!("Hello World!");
}

```

##### Step 2: Execute in Perl:

println! is a macro that prints text to the console.

A binary can be generated using the Rust compiler: rustc.

```powershell
rustc hello.rs

```
rustc will produce a hello binary that can be executed.

```powershell
$ ./hello
Hello World!
```

#### Step 3: Run your app:
Click 'Run' above to see the expected output. Next, add a new line with a second println! macro so that the output shows:

```powershell
Hello World!
I'm a Rustacean!
```

## Help - ?

In this program, we take two different sets and perform different set operations on them. This can equivalently done by using set methods.
